with git flow should hotfix and release branches merged into main be squashed or not
ChatGPT said:
Great question ‚Äî this comes down to the philosophy behind Git Flow and how you want to manage your project‚Äôs history. Let‚Äôs break it down:

üîπ Git Flow Basics
Release branches: Stabilization branches that prepare a new production release (bug fixes, version bumps, documentation updates).

Hotfix branches: Critical fixes applied directly to production that need to go out immediately.

In Git Flow, both release and hotfix branches are merged into main (production-ready branch) and into develop (to keep future development aligned).

üîπ Squash vs. Merge Commit
‚úÖ Merge commits (no squash)
Pros:

Keeps the full commit history from the branch.

Easier to trace individual bugfixes and changes later.

Aligns with the intent of Git Flow: every release and hotfix is a ‚Äúsignificant event‚Äù in history.

Cons:

History can get noisy if the branch had lots of small WIP commits.

‚úÖ Squash merge
Pros:

Produces a cleaner main history (one commit per release/hotfix).

Easier to scan through when reviewing past releases.

Cons:

Loses granular commit history (all small commits collapse into one).

Makes cherry-picking or bisecting harder if you need to debug.

üîπ Common Practice with Git Flow
Hotfix branches ‚Üí Usually merge (no squash) into main because you want the exact fix history preserved for traceability, especially since these are urgent patches.

Release branches ‚Üí Often also merge (no squash) because a release is a major milestone and may contain multiple fixes that you don‚Äôt want to lose context on. Many teams tag the merge commit with the release version.

That said, some teams adopt a hybrid:

Squash merge into develop (to keep it clean).

Normal merge into main (to preserve the ‚Äúwhat went live‚Äù history).

üîπ Recommendation
If you‚Äôre strictly following Git Flow, the convention is:

Do not squash hotfixes or releases when merging into main.

Tag the merge commit with the release or hotfix version (e.g., v2.3.1).

Optionally squash when merging back into develop if you want a tidier history.

üëâ Do you want me to sketch out a Git log example (with and without squash) so you can see how the history looks in practice?

You said:
Is it possible in git hub to make a rule that requires merges to develop to me squash merges unless they are merges from release/* or hotfix/*. I would want features to squash but release and hotfix not to in order to keepthere from being merge conflicts with main
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 32s
Short answer: not natively. On GitHub today you can (a) enable/disable merge methods repo-wide and (b) enforce linear history per branch, but you can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúPRs into develop must be squash unless the head is release/* or hotfix/*.‚Äù The merge method choice isn‚Äôt expressible in branch protections or rulesets with that level of conditional logic.

What you can do instead (practical setups)
Repo settings + status check workaround (most common)

Leave both ‚ÄúMerge Commit‚Äù and ‚ÄúSquash and Merge‚Äù enabled repo-wide.

Add a required status check (via GitHub Actions) that fails if:

base is develop and head matches feature/* and PR has >1 commit (forcing contributors to squash in their branch before merge), but

skips when head is release/* or hotfix/*.

Make that check required in your develop branch protection.
This enforces ‚Äúfeature PRs appear as a single commit‚Äù while allowing normal merges for release/* and hotfix/*. (GitHub doesn‚Äôt let a check read the chosen merge method pre-merge, but enforcing ‚Äú1 commit in the PR‚Äù effectively forces squashing.) 
GitHub Docs

Minimal example workflow (.github/workflows/enforce-squash.yml):

name: Enforce squash-like history for features into develop
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened, edited]
    branches: [develop]

jobs:
  enforce:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check branch policy
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const base = context.payload.pull_request.base.ref;
            const head = context.payload.pull_request.head.ref;
            // Skip for release/* and hotfix/*
            if (/^(release|hotfix)\//.test(head)) {
              core.notice('Skipping check for release/hotfix');
              return;
            }
            if (!/^feature\//.test(head)) {
              core.notice('Non-feature branch; skipping');
              return;
            }
            // Count commits in the PR
            const { data: commits } = await github.rest.pulls.listCommits({
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              pull_number: context.payload.pull_request.number,
              per_page: 250
            });
            if (commits.length > 1) {
              core.setFailed(`Feature PRs into ${base} must be a single commit. Rebase/squash locally.`);
            }
Then mark this workflow as a required status check under the develop protection rule. 
GitHub Docs

‚ÄúRequire linear history‚Äù on develop

Turn on Require linear history for develop. That forbids merge commits, implicitly allowing only squash/rebase results into develop.

For syncing from main back to develop after a release/hotfix, open a PR from main to develop and use Rebase and merge so history stays linear. (You won‚Äôt get a merge commit for those syncs, but you avoid conflicts by keeping develop caught up with main after every release.) 
GitHub Docs

Rulesets for targeting branches (not merge methods)

GitHub rulesets let you target conditions like branch name patterns and require checks/reviews, but they still can‚Äôt switch allowed merge methods based on the source branch. Use them to scope the status check in (1) to just develop. 
GitHub Docs
+1

TL;DR recommendation for Git Flow teams
Goal: ‚ÄúFeature ‚Üí develop must appear as one commit; release/* and hotfix/* should keep full history to reduce drift with main.‚Äù

Do this: Implement the required status check pattern (Option 1) and keep a tight ‚Äúsync main ‚Üí develop after every release/hotfix‚Äù habit.

If you‚Äôre okay with a linear develop, also enable Require linear history on develop (Option 2).

If you want, I can drop a ready-to-paste Actions workflow that also comments helpful guidance on the PR when it fails, and we can tweak the branch globs to match your naming.

You said:
is there a way to simultanously create a PR that has one approval but merges to two places? ie hotfix that merges into main and develop or release that merges to both?
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 39s
Short answer: No‚Äîa GitHub pull request can only target one base branch at a time, so you can‚Äôt merge a single PR into both main and develop with one approval. A PR is always ‚Äúhead ‚Üí base (one branch)‚Äù. 
GitHub Docs

How teams handle hotfix/release ‚Üí both branches
Merge once, then auto-backport/cherry-pick

Merge the PR to main (hotfix) or to release/*.

A GitHub Action runs on merge and backports the commits to develop (or opens a PR from main ‚Üí develop).

Popular Actions:

korthout/backport-action (label-driven or always-on) 
GitHub
+1

sorenlouv/backport-github-action (label prefix like backport-to-develop) 
GitHub

Other backport Actions exist with auto-PR/automerge options. 
GitHub
+1

Minimal example (.github/workflows/backport.yml), triggers when a merged PR has backport-to-develop:

name: Backport to develop
on:
  pull_request_target:
    types: [labeled, closed]
jobs:
  backport:
    if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true &&
        contains(github.event.pull_request.labels.*.name, 'backport-to-develop')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: sorenlouv/backport-github-action@v9.5.1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          targetBranches: 'develop'
(You can flip this to always backport hotfixes by keying off branch name or PR title instead of a label.)

Merge once, then auto-open a sync PR (main ‚Üí develop)

After a hotfix merges to main, an Action pushes a branch from main and opens a sync PR into develop.

This keeps develop aligned without altering your merge method choices. (Enforce approvals on that sync PR via branch protection as usual.) 
GitHub Docs

Notes on ‚Äúone approval‚Äù
Because GitHub treats the backport/sync as a separate PR, it will need its own approvals if your branch protection rules require them. You can streamline with CODEOWNERS or a machine user if allowed, but there isn‚Äôt a native way to ‚Äúreuse‚Äù the first PR‚Äôs approval. 
GitHub Docs
+1

TL;DR: You can‚Äôt merge one PR into two branches. Use an automation to backport or open a follow-up sync PR automatically after the first merge. This is the standard way to implement Git Flow hotfix/release back-merges on GitHub.

You said:
is it normal in gitflow to merge release and hotfix branches to both main and develop or to merge main back to develop after the release or hotfix commit is complete. explain the pros and cons of each
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 23s
Short version: Both patterns are used. Classic Git Flow says: merge release/ and hotfix/ into main and back into develop. Plenty of teams instead merge to main and then do a single sync PR from main ‚Üí develop. Here‚Äôs how they compare.

Option A ‚Äî Merge release/* & hotfix/* into both main and develop (canonical Git Flow)
Pros

Traceability: History shows exactly which changes arrived via the release/hotfix branch (good for audits and blame/bisect).

Scope control: You only bring back the changes from that branch; you don‚Äôt accidentally pull unrelated main-only commits.

Clean tagging/story: The merge commits and tags line up with the release/hotfix branch names.

Cons

More ceremony: Two PRs/merges to maintain (easy to forget the ‚Äúback to develop‚Äù one without automation).

History shape: Develop can get ‚Äúmerge bubbles‚Äù unless you rebase-merge those PRs.

Human error risk: People might squash when you don‚Äôt want them to, or pick the wrong merge method.

Option B ‚Äî Merge to main, then open a sync PR main ‚Üí develop
Pros

Fewer moving parts: One primary PR (to main) plus an automated follow-up PR keeps people from forgetting the back-merge.

Single conflict point: Any divergence between main and develop is resolved once, in the sync PR.

Easy to automate: A GitHub Action can open the sync PR automatically on every hotfix/release merge to main.

Cons

Less explicit provenance: History on develop shows ‚Äúmerged main‚Äù rather than ‚Äúmerged release/1.2.0,‚Äù which can reduce clarity.

Broader scope: If main ever accrues anything else (shouldn‚Äôt, but happens), the sync PR pulls it all into develop.

Aggregated changes: A sync PR might mix multiple hotfixes; bisecting ‚Äúwhich release reintroduced this‚Äù can be noisier.

What I recommend in practice
If your top priority is auditability/traceability (seeing each release/hotfix flow into develop), use Option A and automate the second PR creation so it never gets missed.

If your top priority is operational simplicity (reduce human steps/conflicts), use Option B: merge to main, auto-open a sync PR main ‚Üí develop, and rebase-merge it to keep develop linear.

Tips whichever route you pick
Merge methods: Don‚Äôt squash release/hotfix into main; consider rebase (or merge commit) for back-merges/sync PRs.

Tagging: Tag on main only (e.g., v2.3.1) to keep a single source of truth for releases.

Automation: Add a CI job that either (A) opens the develop back-merge PR after a release/hotfix merge, or (B) opens a main ‚Üí develop sync PR. Make that PR follow your normal review rules.

Consistency: Pick one pattern and codify it in your CONTRIBUTING.md/PR template and branch protections. Consistency > which pattern.

          # gh pr merge --auto --rebase
Notes
Uses a fixed sync branch so there‚Äôs only ever one open PR; each run force-updates it to the latest main.

Skips opening a PR when develop is already up-to-date.

Requires repo settings to allow the default GITHUB_TOKEN to write PRs (the permissions block above handles this).

If develop has Require linear history, prefer Rebase and merge for the PR (see the commented gh pr merge --auto --rebase).

where do I go to set the repo settings to allow that GITHUB_TOKEN the correct permissions
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 1m 19s
Here‚Äôs where to turn it on:

Repo level (most common)

Go to your repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General.

Scroll to Workflow permissions and select ‚ÄúRead and write permissions.‚Äù

(Optional) check ‚ÄúAllow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests.‚Äù

Click Save. 
GitHub Docs
GitHub

If those options are grayed out

Your org is enforcing this at a higher level. Ask an org admin to go to Organization settings ‚Üí Actions ‚Üí General ‚Üí Workflow permissions and enable Read and write (and optionally the create/approve PRs toggle). Repos inherit from here. 
The GitHub Blog

Also set permissions in the workflow (best practice)
Even with repo/org settings, explicitly request the least privileges your job needs:

permissions:
  contents: write        # push the sync branch
  pull-requests: write   # open/edit PRs
This overrides the defaults just for that workflow/job. 
GitHub Docs

Notes
‚Ä¢ Fork PRs and Dependabot-triggered runs get a read-only GITHUB_TOKEN by design; your ‚Äúopen PR‚Äù job should run on pushes from your own repo (like push: [main]).

Your script is working, can we modify it slightly to actually merge the sync PR, but only if that PR has no conflicts essentially enable auto merge
ChatGPT said:

Thought for 54s
Absolutely‚Äîwe can extend your workflow so it enables auto-merge on the sync PR, but only when it‚Äôs conflict-free. Below is a drop-in update that:

opens/updates the sync/main-to-develop PR,

checks its mergeability (polls until GitHub finishes computing it),

if there are no conflicts, turns on auto-merge (rebase) so GitHub merges it as soon as required checks/approvals are satisfied.

Before using this, make sure the repo has Allow auto-merge enabled in Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Pull Requests. Otherwise the ‚Äúauto‚Äù flag won‚Äôt take effect.

          fi
Why this works
Conflict gate: We only proceed when mergeable == "MERGEABLE"; if it‚Äôs CONFLICTING, we leave the PR for a human to resolve. (GitHub computes this asynchronously, hence the short poll.) 
GitHub Docs

Auto-merge: gh pr merge --auto --rebase tells GitHub to merge once all protections pass‚Äîperfect for ‚Äúmerge when green‚Äù flows. Requires ‚ÄúAllow auto-merge‚Äù in repo settings. 
GitHub CLI
GitHub Docs

Rebase strategy: Using --rebase keeps develop linear if you‚Äôve enabled ‚ÄúRequire linear history.‚Äù If you prefer a merge commit, swap to --merge on both lines. 
GitHub Docs

If you‚Äôd like, I can add a label, a reviewer, or auto-delete the sync branch after merge (currently only in the immediate-merge fallback).
